					<p>
						Getting in shape shouldn't be a punishment. It's an amazing and
						empowering lifestyle decision that anyone can make. I believe in
						finding the pleasurable side of fitness; and while there may be a
						sore muscle or two along the way, the benefits of fitness are worth
						the challenge. I have developed my training regime by working with a
						variety of people, and constantly adapting my program to the needs
						of my new clients.
